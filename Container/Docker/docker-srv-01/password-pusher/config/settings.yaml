# Global Application Configuration
#
# This file uses YAML syntax.  Indentation must be 2 spaces (not tabs).
#
# See also https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/blob/master/Configuration.md
# for a further explanation of the larger settings available here.

### Application Defaults
#

### URL Pushes
#
# Enable or disable URL based pushes.  These allow you to share URLs securely.
# Like regular pushes, they expire after a set time or amount of views.
#
# Note that `enable_logins` is required for URL based pushes to work.  It is a
# feature for logged in users only.
#
# Environment variable override:
# PWP__ENABLE_URL_PUSHES='false'
#
enable_url_pushes: true

### File Uploads
#
# File uploads are disabled by default since they require a place to store
# those files.
#
# If enabling file uploads, make sure to fill out the 'files' section below.
#
# Note that `enable_logins` is required for file uploads to work.  It is a
# feature for logged in users only.
#
# Environment variable override:
# PWP__ENABLE_FILE_PUSHES='false'
#
enable_file_pushes: true

### Logins (User accounts)
#
# Logins are disabled by default since they require an MTA (email) server
# available to send emails through.
#
# If enabling logins, make sure to fill out the 'mail' section below.
#
# For instructions on how to enable logins, see this page:
# https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/discussions/276
#
# Environment variable override:
# PWP__ENABLE_LOGINS='false'
#
enable_logins: true

## Disable Signups
#
# Disallow new user accounts to be created in the application.
#
# Set this after you have your desired user accounts created.  It will
# not allow any further user account creation.
#
# Environment variable override:
# PWP__DISABLE_SIGNUPS='false'
#
disable_signups: false

## Limit Signups to Specific Email Domains
#
# By default, anyone can sign up for an account.  The following default regular
# expression just validates if it is a valid email address.
#
# signup_email_regexp: '\A[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\z'
#
# If you would like to limit signups to specific email domains, you can extend
# the regular expression below to include the domains you want to allow.
#
# For example, to only allow signups from the domain 'hey.com', you would
# change the following to:
#
#   signup_email_regexp: '\A[^@\s]+@(hey\.com)\z'
#
# or for multiple domains:
#
#  signup_email_regexp: '\A[^@\s]+@(hey\.com|gmail\.com)\z'
#
# Tip: use https://rubular.com to test out your regular expressions. It includes
# a guide to what each component means in regexp.
#
# Environment variable override:
# PWP__SIGNUP_EMAIL_REGEXP='\A[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\z'
#
signup_email_regexp: '\A[^@\s]+@(soniiit\.net|itcares\.de)\z'

### Allow Anonymous
#
# By default, Password Pusher can be used by anonymous users to push
# new passwords and generate secret URLs.  If you want to limit functionality
# to logged in  users only, set the following value to true.
#
# This does not affect password secret URLs themselves as anonymous is always
# allowed there.
#
# Environment variable override:
# PWP__ALLOW_ANONYMOUS='true'
#
allow_anonymous: true

### Host Domain
#
# The domain (without protocol) where this instance is hosted
# Used in generating fully qualified URLs.
#
# Make sure to set this for email links to work correctly.
#
# Environment variable override:
# PWP__HOST_DOMAIN='pwpush.com'
#
host_domain: 'pwpush.soniiit.net'

### Host Protocol
#
# The protocol to reach the domain above
# Used in generating fully qualified URLs.
#
# Make sure to set this for email links to work correctly.
#
# Environment variable override:
# PWP__HOST_PROTOCOL='https'
#
host_protocol: 'https'

### Base URL Override
#
# Set the following value to force the base URL of generated links.
#
# Environment variable override:
# PWP__OVERRIDE_BASE_URL='https://pwpush.mydomain.com'
#
# You could even add a port if needed:
# PWP__OVERRIDE_BASE_URL='https://pwpush.mydomain.com:5100'
#
# Set this value without a trailing slash ('/').
#
override_base_url: 'https://pwpush.soniiit.net'

### Show version on the footer
#
# Enable/disable PasswordPusher version on the footer.
#
# Environment variable override:
# PWP__SHOW_VERSION=true
#
# Default: true
show_version: false

#
# Environment variable override:
# PWP__SHOW_GDPR_CONSENT_BANNER=true
#
# Default: true
show_gdpr_consent_banner: true

#
# Set the timezone for the application.  A full list of timezone strings
# can be found here:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
#
# Environment variable override:
# PWP__TIMEZONE='America/New_York'
#
# Default: 'America/New_York'
timezone: 'Europe/Berlin'

### Allowed Hosts
#
# This is a list of allowed hosts for the application.  This is used to
# prevent host header attacks.
#
# When set, the application will only respond to requests with a host header
# that matches one of the values in this list.
#
# This feature is generally only used when the application is behind a proxy.
#
# It's generally not required to use this unless you are getting the related error
# in the application.  localhost and the IP that the application is running on
# are always allowed.
#
# Note: If you need more than one value to the environment variable, separate
# entries by a single space.
#
# Environment variable override:
# PWP__ALLOWED_HOSTS='pwpush.com pwpush.mydomain.com pwpush.myotherdomain'
#
allowed_hosts:
  - 'pwpush.soniiit.net'
  - '192.168.178.40:5100'
#   - 'pwpush.myotherdomain.com'

  #
  # Setting this option to false will disable the blur feature entirely for password pushes.

### Throttling
#
# Configure the application throttling limits.
#
# Throttling enforces a minimum time interval
# between subsequent HTTP requests from a particular client, as
# well as by defining a maximum number of allowed HTTP requests
# per a given time period (per second or minute)
#
# See https://github.com/rack/rack-attack
#
throttling:
  # ..maximum number of allowed HTTP requests per minute
  #
  # Default: 120
  #
  # Environment Variable Override: PWP__THROTTLING__MINUTE='60'
  minute: 120

  # ..maximum number of allowed HTTP requests per second
  #
  # Default: 60
  #
  # Environment Variable Override: PWP__THROTTLING__SECOND='20'
  second: 60


### Mail Server Configuration
#
# When logins are enabled, an SMTP server is required to send emails to users
# for things such as forgot password, unlock account, confirm account etc.
# If `enable_logins` is set to true above, the following _are required_ to be
# filled out with valid values.
#
# These values are passed through to ActionMailer configuration.  The documentation
# for ActionMailer is at:
# https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#action-mailer-configuration
#
# IMPORTANT: Also set host_domain and host_protocol above for email links to work correctly!
#

#   # Environment Variable Override: PWP__MAIL__SMTP_PORT='587'

#
#   # If your mail server requires authentication, you need to specify the
#   # authentication type here. This is a string and one of :plain (will send
#   # the password in the clear), :login (will send password Base64 encoded)
#   # or :cram_md5 (combines a Challenge/Response mechanism to exchange
#   # information and a cryptographic Message Digest 5 algorithm to hash
#   # important information)
#   #
#   # Important: Comment this out if your server doesn't require authentication.

### Docker Pre-compilation
#
# This is useful if you modified the assets (e.g. CSS, JS, images) to customize
# the theme etc...  Assets are precompiled before serving.
#
# If you set a custom theme, you will need to precompile the assets on container boot.
#
# Pre-compilation isn't supported in this yaml file.  It is only supported
# through the environment variable PWP_PRECOMPILE='true'.
#
# See the following for more information:
# https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/blob/master/Configuration.md#how-to-precompile-css-assets
#
# Environment Variable: PWP_PRECOMPILE='false'

### Themes
#
# Password Pusher uses Bootswatch themes.  See https://bootswatch.com/
#
# The following are the available themes.  The default theme is 'default'.
#
#   'cerulean', 'cosmo', 'cyborg', 'darkly', 'flatly', 'journal', 'litera', 'lumen',
#   'lux', 'materia', 'minty', 'morph', 'pulse', 'quartz', 'sandstone', 'simplex',
#   'sketchy', 'slate', 'solar', 'spacelab', 'superhero', 'united', 'vapor', 'yeti', 'zephyr'
#
# To change the theme, set the `theme` value to the name of the theme you
# want to use.
#
# Environment Variable Override: PWP__THEME='default'
#
# Important Note: This setting can only be controlled by environment variable. (PWP__THEME)
#                 It cannot be set in this config file.
# theme: 'default'

### Site Default Locale
#
# The default language for the application.  This must be one of the
# valid/supported language codes from the list above.
#

# Example: default_locale: :es
#
# Environment Variable Override: PWP__DEFAULT_LOCALE='es'
